    "* Test on the examples from the problem statement.\n",
    "* Make a few other small test, solve them manually and check that your program output the correct answer. \n",
    "* Generate a big input and launch your program to check that it works fast enough and doesn’t consume too much memory. \n",
    "* Test for corner cases: smallest allowed value and largest allowed value (for integer overflow) of all input parameters, equal numbers in the input, verylong strings etc.\n",
    "* Make stress test (comparison between naive and implementation to be considered with generated random inputs).\n",

    "* Pisano period: \n",
    "  * For any integer $m≥2$, the sequence $F_{n}$ mod m is periodic. The period always starts with *0 1* and is known as Pisano period. \n",

    "* Runtime depends on program and system used to run it. Increament because of system related factors like speed of computer, system architecture, compiler being used and detail of memory hirerarchy etc. is not so straight forward to calcuate but it multiply runtime by a (large) constant. so we need a method to measure runtime which ignore constant multiples.\n",

    "  * Common rules of Big-O notation:\n",
    "    * Multiplicative constant could be omitted \n",
    "    * Leave lower order term which becomes less significant as n grows and hence $5n^2 + 3n + 2$ becomes $O(n^2)$.\n",
    "    * Note that growth rate of $5n^2 + 3n + 2$ is same as $n^2$\n",
    "    * In order to keep bigger picture, we treat two functions equivalent if they differ only by multiplicative constant such that $f1/f2 <= constant1 \\newline and \\newline f2/f2 <= constant2$ \n",
