    Pre-requisite:
        Basic knowledge of programming language you would like to use
        Basic knowledge of discrete mathematics: proof by induction, proof by contradiction
            Recommended course specialization: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics?utm_source=algoreading#courses

    Testing:
        - Test on the examples from the problem statement. 
        - Then make a few other small test, solve them manually and check that your program output the correct answer. 
        - Generate a big input and launch your program to check that it works fast enough and doesn‚Äôt consume too much memory. 
        - Test for corner cases: smallest allowed value and largest allowed value (for ineger overflow) of all input parameters, equal numbers in the input, very long strings etc. 
        - Then make stress test (comparison between naive and implementation to be connsidered with generated random inputs).

week 2:
    Fibonacci numbers: 

    Gereatest common divisor:

    Pisano period: 
        - For any integer ùëö‚â•2, the sequence ùêπùëõ mod ùëö is periodic. The period always starts with 01 and is known as Pisano period.
        - Because of above property, to caclate Fn mod m where n is very large, find pisano period length of m then divide n by pisano period length, Freminder mod m will be equal to Fn mod m.

    (a+b)%n = ((a%n) + (b%n)) % n
