Testing:
    Test on the examples from the problem statement. Then make a few other small
    test, solve them manually and check that your program output the correct
    answer. Generate a big input and launch your program to check that it works
    fast enough and doesnâ€™t consume too much memory. Test for corner cases:
    smallest allowed value and largest allowed value (for integer overflow) of
    all input parameters, equal numbers in the input, very long strings etc.
    Then make stress test (comparison between naive and implementation to be
    connsidered with generated random inputs).
