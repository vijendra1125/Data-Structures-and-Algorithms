Pre-requisite:
    Basic knowledge of programming language you would like to use
    Basic knowledge of discrete mathematics: proof by induction, proof by contradiction
        Recommended course specialization: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics?utm_source=algoreading#courses
Testing:
    - Test on the examples from the problem statement. 
    - Then make a few other small test, solve them manually and check that your program output the correct answer. 
    - Generate a big input and launch your program to check that it works fast enough and doesn’t consume too much memory. 
    - Test for corner cases: smallest allowed value and largest allowed value (for ineger overflow) of all input parameters, equal numbers in the input, very long strings etc. 
    - Then make stress test (comparison between naive and implementation to be connsidered with generated random inputs).
