General strategy for greedy algorithm:
    Come up with a greedy choice
    Prove that this greedy choice is safe move (there is an optimal solution 
    consistent with the first move)
    Reduce to subproblem (a simillar problem of smaler size) 
    Solve the subproblem by going back to step 1

Good Programming assignments: 5, 7
