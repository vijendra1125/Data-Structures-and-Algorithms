Subproblem is a simillar problem of smaler size. Make a small move and then
solve a problem of same kind. A greedy algorithm is called safe move if there is
an optimal solution consistent with the first move. General strategy for greedy
algorithm:
    - Come up with a greedy choice - Prove that this greedy choice is safe move
    - Reduce to subproblem - solve the subproblem by going back to step 1
Good Programming assignments: 5, 7
